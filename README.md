fonts built from iosevka font's build system, intended for use in a terminal. made to look similar to jetbrains mono, but i attempted to fix some of the things i didn't like about the font, while still working within the limited but super fun customization framework that iosevka provides.

io termina features mostly rounded, bug-eyed characters, while io termina mind has subtly hardened edges for a slightly more rigid feel.
