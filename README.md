Fonts built from Iosevka's base using its build system, intended for use in a terminal. It was made to capture certain stylistic elements of fonts like JetBrains Mono and Terminus, but I attempted to fix some of the things I didn't like about those fonts, while working within the limited but super fun customization framework that Iosevka provides.

_Io Termina_ features mostly rounded, bug-eyed characters, while _Io Termina Mind_ has a subtly hardened corner on the relevant characters (i.e. bdqpnm, etc.) for a slightly less heady feel.

These fonts resemble the aforementioned fonts moreso than they do the classic Iosevka fonts. The elements I like about them are:
- the perfectly shaped center-dotted `0` from JetBrains
- the squircle-y but not too boxy design of rounded characters
- hooked `i` and `j`
- sort of wide spacing
- simplicity

Some unique features are:
- ambigram characters having symmetrical counterparts
    - like `m - w` and `b - d` being truly symmetrical
- `m` and `w` have short middle lines in _Io Termina Mind_ and _Mindless_
